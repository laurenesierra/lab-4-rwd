Style the page using float-based layout to reflect the comp images provided as closely as possible. The only text you should have in each box is the identifying letter, which should be centered horizontally and vertically.
For the desktop view, the content should be inside of a channel that is a maximum of 960 pixels wide and is centered on wider screen sizes.

Each box should have a unique background color in mobile view and in desktop view. These changes should be observed when the screen size changes and the page is refreshed.
